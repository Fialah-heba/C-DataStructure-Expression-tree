# **C-DataStructure-Expression-tree** 
In this project, will be  implement an expression tree to evaluate given
binary arithmetic expressions. This program must read expressions from a
file containing a single equation on each line. The equations are written as infix
expressions. For each line the program should print the value resulting from
evaluating the expression. This program should support the following
operations: + - * / % ( ). White spaces or special characters are ignored.

Example input:

3+5*(10-2)

1+1+1+1*8

100/3/2

100%3


In this case, the output should contain the following:

43

11

16

1

In this project will be use an array implementation of Stack library that will be
use in this work.
This application should be able to show the following information through
a proper menu of the application:
1. Read equations
2. Print equations
3. Evaluate using Expression tree
4. Print postfix expressions
5. Save to output file (postfix and results)
6. Exit

# **C-DataStructure-Expression-tree** 
In this project, you will implement an expression tree to evaluate given
binary arithmetic expressions. Your program must read expressions from a
file containing a single equation on each line. The equations are written as infix
expressions. For each line the program should print the value resulting from
evaluating the expression. Your program should support the following
operations: + - * / % ( ). White spaces or special characters are ignored.
